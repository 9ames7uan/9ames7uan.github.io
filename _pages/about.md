Hello! I am **James C.T. Tuan** (9ames 7uan).

I am an interdisciplinary engineer bridging the gap between **Mechanical Engineering** and **Computer Science**. Currently pursuing my Master's degree in CS, I leverage my background in Power Mechanical Engineering (NTHU 26) to solve complex problems involving both hardware and software.

My research and technical focus include:

* **Web3 & Blockchain**: Actively "Learning in Public" with a focus on the web3, smart contracts, and decentralized governance.
* **Cybersecurity**: Enhancing system security knowledge through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program.

I am passionate about building secure, efficient systems and documenting my technical journey. Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/) or connect with me below.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
